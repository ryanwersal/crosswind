DEVELOPMENT INSTALLATION

The following steps will merge the latest sandbox version of lib2to3
with the latest Python 2.x trunk, such that one can build the 3to2
utility.  You will need both a Subversion and Mercurial client.

The instructions are geared towards Linux, and Mac OS X users note
that the default Python executable will be named 'Python.exe' instead
of just 'python'.

1. Check out two subversion repositories:

   $ svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/2to3 2to3
   $ svn co http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk python-trunk

   Then, replace python-trunk/Lib/lib2to3 with the sandbox version:

   $ rm -rf python-trunk/Lib/lib2to3
   $ cp -r 2to3/lib2to3 python-trunk/Lib/lib2to3

2. Build Python on your system

   $ cd python-trunk && ./configure && make

3. Clone the mercurial repository:

   $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/amentajo/lib3to2/

   Build using Python from Step 2:

   $ ../python-trunk/python 3to2/setup.py build

FULL INSTALLATION

If you want both the latest build of Python and the 3to2 utility in
your $PATH, follow the steps from Development Installation, with two
additional steps:

1. After issuing `make` in python-trunk/, run `make install` as
   privileged user.  Then, you should be able to use `python2.7`.

2. Run 'setup.py build', then 'setup.py install' as a privileged user.

** This step is no longer required to run the test suite.
