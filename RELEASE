=============
3to2 Releases
=============

3to2 0.1a3
==========

General Notes
-------------

- 3to2 now performs an explicit check on the interpreter version
  when run directly and exits when it is incorrect

- Slightly more robust Makefile adds local targets ('install-local',
  'test-local', 'uninstall-local') that use site-directories in users'
  home directories.

- Some documentation fixes

Specific Fixers
---------------

- Fixer added for dictionary and set comprehensions

- Fixer added for extended iterable unpacking in explicit assignment context
  (warns that it cannot convert the implicit assignment context version)


3to2 0.1a2
==========

General Notes
-------------

- Release numbering scheme changed to conform to PEP 386 guidelines.

- Minor documentation improvements.

Specific Fixers
---------------

- new print fix refactors print functions into print statements.


3to2 0.1a1
================

General Notes

Specific Fixers
