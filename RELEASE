crosswind Releases
=============

crosswind 1.0
========

General Notes
-------------

- Calling this 1.0, because it looks pretty close to what it should look like

- Creating a separate branch that uses "two2three" instead of "lib2to3" from
  PyPI as a dependency, to make crosswind more accessible to non-bleeding-edge users

- First release after Google Summer of Code 2010 was finished; various small
  changes are not reported here.


Specific Fixers
---------------

- fix_bytes: much more thorough

- fix_fullargspec: new fixer, fixes "getfullargspec" -> "getargspec"

- fix_raise: added a quick fix for "raise x from y" -> "raise x"

- fix_kwargs: new fixer, fixes keyword-only arguments

- fix_unpacking: added support for implicit assignment context

- fix_open: new fixer, replaces open() with io.open()

- fix_imports and fix_imports2: bugfixes

- fix_unittest: new explicit-only fixer for unittest -> unittest2


crosswind 0.1
========

General Notes
-------------

- First non-alpha, non-beta release!

- Using "#!/usr/bin/env python3.1" instead of "#!/usr/bin/env python3" to
  reflect that crosswind has only been tested with Python 3.1.

Specific Fixers
---------------

- fix_imports2: treating "from dbm import ..." as though it were written
  "from dbm.__init__ import ...", for the purpose of catching whichdb and
  anydbm usage.

- fix_imports2: warning about "from urllib import request" and
  "import urllib.request as spam" ambiguity.


crosswind 0.1b1
==========

General Notes
-------------

- Development is now done exclusively in Python 3, and releases are generated
  by running crosswind on itself.
  For now, this requires that crosswind already be installed.

- Given a recent enough version of lib2to3 installed, crosswind will now run on
  Python 2.5.

Specific Fixers
---------------

- fix_imports2 rewritten, now fixes cases of "from urllib.request import ..."
  and "import urllib.request".  No fixes are currently planned for the
  "from urllib import request" or "import urllib.request as spam" wordings.


crosswind 0.1a3
==========

General Notes
-------------

- crosswind now performs an explicit check on the interpreter version
  when run directly and exits when it is incorrect

- Slightly more robust Makefile adds local targets ('install-local',
  'test-local', 'uninstall-local') that use site-directories in users'
  home directories.

- Some documentation fixes

Specific Fixers
---------------

- Fixer added for dictionary and set comprehensions

- Fixer added for extended iterable unpacking in explicit assignment context
  (warns that it cannot convert the implicit assignment context version)


crosswind 0.1a2
==========

General Notes
-------------

- Release numbering scheme changed to conform to PEP 386 guidelines.

- Minor documentation improvements.

- Removed an unnecessary line that was causing a DeprecationWarning.

Specific Fixers
---------------

- print fix renamed to printfunction and made explicit only.

- new print fix refactors print functions into print statements.


crosswind 0.1a1
================

General Notes
-------------

- First release after Google Summer of Code 2009(tm)

Specific Fixers
---------------

- imports and imports2 fixes are explicit-only due to known crashes.  Run crosswind
  with the -fimports and/or -fimports2 switch to enable those fixes only.

- features fix might not fix all features.
